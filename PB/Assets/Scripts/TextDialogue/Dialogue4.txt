Child... do you want to defeat the crabs?
What..? How did you know?
I have my ways. 
Who are you?
I am old man Aldweiner. 
Oh. 
There's something that you must do in order to defeat the crabs. 
What is it?
See that mountain over there?
The really tall one?
Well, yeah. There's a stone called the Endothermiosiscoliflower.
Wow, that's long.
That's what she said.
...
Anyways, this stone is the key to turning off all of Crab Corps machinery. 
What will that do?
That'll make global warming stop because Crab Corbs produces 90% of the CO2 in the air.
Does that causes the planet to warm?
Yeah, ya dumb butt.
Oh, okay. So how do I get the stone?
By climbing the mountain. The Endothermiosiscoliflower is on the top. Have fun.
