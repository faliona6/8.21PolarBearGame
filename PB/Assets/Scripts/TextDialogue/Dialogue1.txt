Zacharias... I want you to know... that I've always loved you.
Mom... what are you talking about?
I-I don't have much time left. It was the crabs.
The crabs?
Yes. The crabs. They came and took all of our food supply. 
The world is now warming and melting right through our claws.
Where are you going, mom?
I'll always be... right here... with you...
Mom..? Mom wake up. Mom! MOM! MOOOOOOM!!!!
